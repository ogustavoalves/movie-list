### 'Movie List'
#### This project is based on the Alura's "seven days of code": https://7daysofcode.io/matricula/javascript-e-dom-api

Some features and details I still wanna work on:

- Pagination functionality;
- Show less movies per search (currently the number is ten at the maximum but I want to lower that to five or seven);
- Transform the "Favorites checkbox" into a button;
- Work on the resposivity for the mobile devices;
- Improve the app behavior when "unfavoriting" a movie.
