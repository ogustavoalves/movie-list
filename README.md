<h2>'Movie List'</h2> 
<h4>This project is based on the Alura's "seven days of code": https://7daysofcode.io/matricula/javascript-e-dom-api</h4> 
<div>
  <h4>Description and Goal</h4> 
  <p>The main goal is to consume an API from "The Movies Database", creating a front-end interface where the user can search and save their favorite movies.</p>
  <h4>Technologies I've Used:</h4>

  <p>My personal goal was <b>to learn and practice javascript DOM manipulation</b>.</p>

  <h3>Some features and details I still wanna work on:</h3>

  - Pagination functionality;
  - Show less movies per search (currently the number is ten at the maximum but I want to lower that to five or seven);
  - Transform the "Favorites checkbox" into a button;
  - Work on the resposivity for the mobile devices;
  - Improve the app behavior when "unfavoriting" a movie.
